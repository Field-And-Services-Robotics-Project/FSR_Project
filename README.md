# FSR_Project
This repository contains the following MATLAB/Simulink files:
1) init_snake.m: This is the init function for the simulink model which contains all the parameters 
2) snak.slx: This is the simulink model
3) visualization2D.m: This script plots the final position and center of mass path in a 2D visualization mode
4) visualization3D.m: This script plots the motion of the snake and center of mass path in a 3D visualization mode

To start the model just run the simulink model snake.slx after the simulation is done run the visualization2D or visualization3D script to see the results
